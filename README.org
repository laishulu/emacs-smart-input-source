* About
~sis~ (smart input source) is to switch native or OS input source (input method)
smartly:

- A global mode: ~sis-global-respect-mode~ to respect buffer/mode
  by proper input source
  1. Respect start: start Emacs with specified language.
  2. Respect ~evil~: switch to English when leaving ~evil~ ~insert~ mode.
  3. Respect ~minibuffer~: switch to English when enter ~minibuffer~.
  4. Respect prefix key: switch to English for ~C-c~ / ~C-x~ / ~C-h~ and more.
  5. Respect buffer: recover buffer input source when it regain focus.
- A buffer local mode: ~sis-follow-context-mode~ to switch input
  source smarted according to context. It also has a global version
  ~sis-global-follow-context-mode~ to enable the mode for all
  buffers. When to switch input source by following context can be configured
  easily by a variable, whose default value indicates when entering evil insert
  mode.
- A buffer local mode: ~sis-inline-mode~ to enable the
  automatically triggering of a temporary overlay to input English/other
  language and then back to original input source without switching input
  sources manually. It also has a global version
  ~sis-global-inline-mode~ to enable the mode for all buffers.
- A global mode: ~sis-global-cursor-color-mode~ to automatically
  change cursor color according to current input source.

* Features
1. Ease the use of OS-native input source, no need to change use experience.
2. Ease the use of Emacs-native input source, for further compatibility. 
3. Support GUI Emacs, as well as Terminal Emacs.
4. Easy to install and configure. No further configuration for
   ~GUI Emacs Mac Port~ with ~Sogou Input~.
5. Automatically change cursor color according to current input source.
6. Respect buffer/mode by proper input source:
   1) Respect start: start Emacs with specified language.
   2) Respect ~evil~: switch to English when leaving ~evil~ ~insert~ mode.
   3) Respect ~minibuffer~: switch to English when enter ~minibuffer~.
   4) Respect prefix key: switch to English for ~C-c~ / ~C-x~ / ~C-h~ and more.
   5) Respect buffer: recover buffer input source when it regain focus.
7. Support ~inline English~ and ~inline other language~ region. Features of the
   inline region (~inline english~ as an example):
   1) Inserting space around none-English characters triggers the region (two
      consecutive spaces for ~inline other language~ region).
   2) In this mode, English will be sticked.
   3) Region is closed when:
      a. Cursor leaves the region
      b. ~Return~ is pressed.
      c. Two consecutive ~space~ are input (can be configured to one ~space~).
   4) If the region ends with space, none-English input source will be
      selected, otherwise English input source is retained.
   5) After the close of the region, one space (can be configured) in the head
      and tail respectively (if exists) of the region will be deleted. But if
      the whole region is blank, the no character will be deleted.
8. Switch input source according to context:
   1) Pre-configured for entering evil insert mode.
   2) For native emacs user, you can configure by easily set a variable.
9. Input source switching rules are designed carefully, for pure English
   editing, input source will never be switched to other languages.

* Install
Just install ~sis~ from ~melpa~.

* Prepare /input source manager (ISM)/
** Emacs-native input method
Here uses ~rime~ as an example:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(sis-ism-lazyman-config nil "rime" 'native)
#+END_SRC


** MacOS
The default MacOS input sources are shown in the following.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; Not needed if your input sources are the same with the default values
(sis-ism-lazyman-config
 "com.apple.keylayout.US"
 "com.sogou.inputmethod.sogou.pinyin")
#+END_SRC

Note:
1. Your English input source *MAY NOT* be the default one. Use command
   ~sis-get~ in Emacs to get the correct one.
2. According to your use case, ~EMP~ or ~macism~ should be installed.

*** GUI Emacs Mac Port (EMP)
EMP is a Emacs distribution enhanced for MacOS. It has builtin native API to
interact with MacOS input sources efficiently. EMP can be installed by the
following commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac --with-modules --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick --with-natural-title-bar
#+END_SRC

*** ~macism~
If your Emacs is not GUI EMP, the pre-configured ~macism~ should be installed.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew tap laishulu/macism
brew install macism
#+END_SRC
Note:
- The first time when you use ~macism SOME_INPUT_SOURCE_ID~ in your app,
  MacOS will popup a window asking you to grant permission of Accessibility, you
  can also grant the permission manually following the instructions in [[https://github.com/laishulu/macism/][macism]].
- On a slow computer, ~macism~ needs sleep time (in micro seconds) longer than
  default to work with Accessibility. The default can be overwritten by the
  following codes.
  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq sis-do-set
      (lambda(source) (start-process "set-input-source" nil "macism" source "50000")))
  #+END_SRC
- Don't use ~Alacritty~ for TUI Emacs, because it can't handle deleting
  as well as ~Option~ and ~Command~ key properly when input method is on. I just
  recommend ~kitty~ until ~Alacirtty~ fixed those long existing bugs.
- If you have problems on granting permission of Accessibility for Emacs, see
  below:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Some Emacs "distributions" package together a number of Emacs binaries for
  various macOS versions in a single folder, and dynamically at runtime chooses
  the right one for your system. This means that the icon you click to start the
  program is really a "placeholder" that is not Emacs itself, but rather just
  starts up Emacs. This "placeholder" often takes the form of a Ruby script. If
  this is the case, you'll need to drag the Ruby program on to the list. Ruby
  comes with macOS by default. You can find the program by opening Finder, and
  then from the "Go" menu choose "Go to Folder". Enter "/usr/bin" and you'll get
  that folder opened in Finder. In the folder, you'll find the ruby program that
  you can drag on to the Accessibility list.
  #+END_QUOTE

** Microsoft Windows
*** ~im-select~
[[https://github.com/daipeihust/im-select][im-select]] can be used as a drop-in replacement of ~macism~ in Microsoft Windows.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(sis-ism-lazyman-config "1033" "2052" 'im-select)
#+END_SRC

However, because even though ~im-select~ supports switching different input
languages, it does not support multiple input methods in the same lanuage,
thus you should ensure that in each input language there is only one input
method, just like the following screenshot.

#+CAPTION: Smart input source
[[./screenshots/windows-im-select.jpg]]

** Linux
*** ~fcitx~
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(sis-ism-lazyman-config "1" "2" 'fcitx)
#+END_SRC

*** ~fcitx5~
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(sis-ism-lazyman-config "1" "2" 'fcitx5)
#+END_SRC

*** ~ibus~
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(sis-ism-lazyman-config "xkb:us::eng" "OTHER_INPUT_SOURCE" 'ibus)
#+END_SRC

** Internals for configuring ISM
The core of the configuring of ISM is the two variables :
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq sis-do-get
      #'YOUR_DO_GET_INPUT_SOURCE_FUNCTION)
(setq sis-do-set
      #'YOUR_DO_SET_INPUT_SOURCE_FUNCTION)
#+END_SRC

They are provided for ~EMP~ and ~macism~ by default.

If you have a ISM ~YOUR_ISM~:
+ Run ~YOUR_ISM~ will output the current input source
+ Run ~YOUR_ISM INPUT_SOURCE_ID~ will select ~INPUT_SOURCE_ID~.

Then you can simply use ~YOUR_ISM~ as a drop in replacement for ~macism~:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq sis-external-ism "YOUR_ISM")
#+END_SRC

You can configure ISM by yourself, but a convenient command
~sis-ism-lazyman-config~ is also provided for common ISMs.

* Configure
The mode is designed carefully, so it's safe to enable for all buffers even
its all in English.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(use-package sis
  ;; :hook
  ;; enable the /follow context/ and /inline region/ mode for specific buffers
  ;; (((text-mode prog-mode) . sis-follow-context-mode)
  ;;  ((text-mode prog-mode) . sis-inline-mode))

  :config
  (sis-ism-lazyman-config
   ;; "com.apple.keylayout.ABC"
   "com.apple.keylayout.US"
   ;; "im.rime.inputmethod.Squirrel.Rime"
   "com.sogou.inputmethod.sogou.pinyin")

  ;; enable the /cursor color/ mode
  (sis-global-cursor-color-mode t)
  ;; enable the /respect/ mode
  (sis-global-respect-mode t)
  ;; enable the /follow context/ mode for all buffers
  (sis-global-follow-context-mode t)
  ;; enable the /inline english/ mode for all buffers
  (sis-global-inline-mode t)
  )
#+END_SRC

Tips:
1. For ~spacemacs~, if it works in the ~hybrid~ mode, some of the ~evil~ related
   features may not work. Change to ~vim~ mode instead.

**  Default behavior for /inline english mode/ and /follow context mode/
You can change some of the behaviors by configuring related variables, note:
~inline other language~ feature is turned off by default.

* How to
**  How to get the input source id
After /input source manager/ is configured, you can get your /current
input source id/ by the command ~sis-get~.

**  How the package know the input source change.
1. If your input source is switched from ~sis~, then everything
   should be OK naturally. And your ~sis-auto-refresh-seconds~
   can even be set to ~nil~.
2. If your input source is switched from OS, to detect the switch timely,
   ~sis-auto-refresh-seconds~ should not be too large.
3. To save energy, if the input source is switched from OS during a long idle
   period of Emacs, the package won't be aware in time. Then you can manually
   inform the package by doing anything in Emacs to exit the long idle period,
   or invoke the command ~sis-get~ directly.
